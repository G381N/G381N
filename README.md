# About Me:
Hello there! I'm Gebin George
A developer who loves building things that actually make life easier.
Most of my recent projects are built with React and designed to solve everyday annoyances with simple tools I’d genuinely use and share with friends.
<br>When I’m not in front of a screen, you’ll probably find me out riding through Karnataka or Kerala, chasing sunsets on two wheels, or lifting heavy at the gym just to stay sane. I believe in making things that feel real, useful, and a little fun — whether that’s in code or on the road.
<br>Let’s build something cool. Or break it, learn from it, and build it better.

**“Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as though you were working for the Lord and not for people.” — Colossians 3:23**
